# Powershell Profile
Pretty PowerShell that looks good and functions almost as good as Linux terminal 

## One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

```

```

## Fix the Missing Font
Extract the downloaded `cove.zip` that is in the folder you ran the script from and install the nerd fonts. 

# Sync-profile:
You can use sync-profile.ps1 to sync the microsoft.powershell_profile.ps1 between version 5 and version 7.<br>
This script will copy the file with the latest writetime to the other profile.


# Last updates:
